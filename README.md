# Image-Captioning

### I implemented a full deep learning pipeline that generates captions for images using a CNN encoder and RNN decoder.

The jupyter notebooks do the following:

# 1. Dataset

Loads the [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home) and performs pre-processing.

# 2. Define the Network Architecture

Creates the Convolutional Neural Network and trains the network using the dataset.

# 3. Facial Keypoint Detection, Complete Pipeline

Utilize a haar cascade, transforms, and the convolutional neural network to create a full pipeline that can detect facial keypoints.

The notebooks are fully documented and were completed as a part of Udacity's "Computer Vision" course.
