# Image-Captioning
##An Amazing Project

### I implemented a full deep learning pipeline that generates captions for images using a CNN encoder & RNN decoder.

All code was written using Jupyter Notebook and was created for Udacity's "Computer Vision" course. The Notebooks are also fully documented with visuals, answers, and descriptions. 

# 0. Dataset

Explores the [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home).

# 1. Preliminaries

Loads the [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home) and performs pre-processing. Also design a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating image captions.

# 2. Training

Select the hyperparameters and train the CNN-RNN model.

# 3. Inference

Utilize the CNN-RNN model to generate captions for test images.
